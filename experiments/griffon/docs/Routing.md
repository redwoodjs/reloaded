# Routing

A route matches the path part of a URL to an endpoint. An endpoint is a function that returns a JSX component (A page), or a `Response`. The endpoint function receives the parsed parameters of the path, the context, as well as the `Request`.

## Defining routes

The interface to our router is based off of Remix-Router v7. It is very simplified in that we don't allow nesting or layouts. This might be something we consider in the future, but seems out of scope for routing.

We will use Hono's Routing API: https://hono.dev/docs/api/routing

```ts

import { router } from '@redwoodjs/router'

export default router([
  index(import("./index.tsx")),

  route('auth/login', import('./pages/auth/Login.tsx')),
  route('auth/register', import('./pages/auth/Login.tsx')),
  route('auth/logout', (req, res) => {
    // remove session cookie
    res.redirect('/', 307, {
      'Set-Cookie': `sessionId=${new Date().toString()}; Expires=0`
    })
  }),

  route("invoices", import("./pages/InvoiceList.tsx")),
  route("invoice/:id", import("./pages/InvoiceDetail.tsx")),

  // wildcard
  route("assets/*", (req, res) => {
    // find file on filesystem
    // stream file back
    return res.send(filestream, 200)
  })
])
```

## Things to consider?

- Type safety. How do we ensure that the params have types? Maybe the route array has some sort of response... Like the type that it returns is a function that returns a thing... That's interesting.

Ok. That seems like a possible way forward. What else to consider?

- Type casting? Should we consider have the ability to cast things via the router? Seems like an overreach to me.
Loaders. Stick with Suspense boundary. I kinda see the benefit of been able to declare this on the component itself... Or near the component.

- Don't hide files. I want to be able to follow the request-response cycle in my own code. What does that mean?
- We should expose the express (or something else) part of the framework. The user should invoke a function to pass the request off to Redwood SDK

- Do not use "magic exports" to surface functionality of the frameworL: E.g.: Loader or fetchData, etc.

- Can we chain requests, middleware is awesome? is it?
```ts


export function auth(req, res, next) {
  // do some auth handling stuff...
  if (req.headers.authorization !== '') {
    return new Response('auth error', 403)
  }
  next()
}

export const r = router([
  route("invoices", [auth, import("./pages/InvoiceList.tsx")]),
])
```

I personally prefer using an array rather than splatting params, but I don't want to move to far from express.
